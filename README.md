## Overview
For my project I wanted to think about games I tend to like. I am not a huge gamer by any means and I often choose more "comfy" or "cozy" games either that or word search so I wanted to make almost like a little Tamagotchi so I made this little cat. It looks more like a mouse but you can feed it, give it a name, give it water, and brush it to boost the animals health and happiness. I based the model off of a cat I used to live with and found this to be really fun. I am still struggling to put full code in to Github and have it show up in the way I think it is supposed to but I am working on it.
